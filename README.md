# QGEM-Dry-Lab

This summer QGEM worked to build a ratiometric biofilm program. This program reads upser inputs of designated protein ratio found in the biofilm, as well as other contstraints designated by the user - such as organism. The program then works to produce the neccessary components, such as promoters and RBS sequences, required to produce such a biofilm. All scripts and files associated with QGEM's ratiometric program are to be run in Python 2.7. 

To run this program, the user needs to intially run the file "RB1". This program determines, the promoter library to be used, as well as the desired protein ratio output.
