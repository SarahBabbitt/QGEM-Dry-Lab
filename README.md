# QGEM-Dry-Lab

This summer QGEM worked to build a ratiometric biofilm program. This program reads upser inputs of designated protein ratio found in the biofilm, as well as other contstraints designated by the user - such as organism. The program then works to produce the neccessary components, such as promoters and RBS sequences, required to produce such a biofilm. 

To run this program, the user needs to intially run the file "RB1". This program determines, the promoter library to be used, as well as the desired protein ratio output.
